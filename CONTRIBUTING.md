Just [open an issue](https://github.com/agner/agner/issues) with your suggestion.

How can I create a new package?
-------------------------------

You can create a spec repository by forking and renaming [template package repo](https://github.com/agner/agner.template)
and later on submitting it for inclusion by [opening an issue](https://github.com/agner/agner/issues). 
The last step is only necessary if you want this package to be published on a "central" index. 
If you want to keep it semi-private, you can just use it from your own index.

Before commiting your agner.config, please make sure you ran `agner verify` on it so it passes at least
some validity checks.
